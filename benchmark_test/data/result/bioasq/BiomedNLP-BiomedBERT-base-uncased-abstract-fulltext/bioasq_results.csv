"have quantitative trait loci affecting splicing ( splicing qtls ) been linked to disease? the spontaneously hypertensive rat ( shr ) is a widely used rodent model of hypertension and metabolic syndrome. previously we identified thousands of cis - regulated expression quantitative trait loci ( eqtls ) across multiple tissues using a panel of rat recombinant inbred ( ri ) strains derived from brown norway and shr progenitors. these cis - eqtls represent potential susceptibility loci underlying physiological and pathophysiological traits manifested in shr. we have prioritized 60 cis - eqtls and confirmed differential expression between the parental strains by quantitative pcr in 43 ( 72 % ) of the eqtl transcripts. these colocalizing correlated cis - eqtls ( c3 - eqtls ) are highly attractive as primary susceptibility loci for the colocalizing pqtls. furthermore, sequence analysis of the c3 - eqtl genes identified single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) that are predicted to affect transcription factor binding affinity, splicing and protein function. these snps, which potentially alter transcript abundance and stability, represent strong candidate factors underlying not just eqtl expression phenotypes, but also the correlated metabolic and physiological traits. in conclusion, by integration of genomic sequence, eqtl and qtt datasets we have identified several genes that are strong positional candidates for pathophysiological traits observed in the shr strain. identifying associations between genotypes and gene expression levels",yes,yes,True,0.00039206815,0.999608
