"Is cytokeratin immunoreactivity useful in the diagnosis of short - segment Barrett ' s oesophagus in Korea? Cytokeratin 7 / 20 staining has been reported to be helpful in diagnosing Barrett ' s oesophagus and gastric intestinal metaplasia. However, this is still a matter of some controversy. To determine the diagnostic usefulness of cytokeratin 7 / 20 immunostaining for short - segment Barrett ' s oesophagus in Korea. In patients with Barrett ' s oesophagus, diagnosed endoscopically, at least two biopsy specimens were taken from just below the squamocolumnar junction. If goblet cells were found histologically with alcian blue staining, cytokeratin 7 / 20 immunohistochemical stains were performed. Intestinal metaplasia at the cardia was diagnosed whenever biopsy specimens taken from within 2 cm below the oesophagogastric junction revealed intestinal metaplasia.

"Is extended aortic replacement in acute type A dissection justifiable? The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all dissected aortic segments if technically possible. Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross - clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra - aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients ( group 1 ). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients ( group 2 ).

"Is routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes really necessary for primary lung cancer? Mediastinal lymph node dissection is an essential component of lung cancer surgery ; however, choosing mediastinal lymph nodes stations to be dissected is subjective. We carried out this research to investigate the need for dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during lung cancer surgery. Patients with primary lung cancer who underwent radical surgery between 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, pathologic, and prognosis data were obtained and analyzed. A total number of 1397 patients were included in this research. The metastasis rate of station 9 was 3. 45 %, which was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations. This metastasis rate was significantly correlated with pT stage, the lobe where the tumor was located, metastasis status of intrapulmonary lymph nodes, pTNM stage, and most of the other mediastinal lymph node stations.
